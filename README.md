# SpriteSheetGenerator and Hex2Colour
---
#### `V1.0.0`

I was working with GDI on a little side project, and was tired of wasting so much time having to recreate my sprite sheet every time I wanted to make a little change, as well as having to swap the red and green channels every time I added a new colour that I copied from online or my photo software's colour picker. 

So I made a couple of simple tools to add a bit of quality of life while working with GDI.


## [SpriteSheetGenerator][SPG]

Simple basic tool for rotating, mirroring, and combining sprites into a single sheet.

Able to generate mirrored and rotated variants of your bitmaps.

Can either combine the bitmaps in sequential order, or by giving up order and packing them into the most efficient space.

## [HEX2Colour][Hex2Col]

A simple tool for converting Hex values into code and extracting color hex values from text. Paste your hex values and click 'Convert,' or input text from a webpage or URL and click 'Harvest.' Customize the output with the ability to define custom naming formats. For array output, simply add a name on the line above the color value. 

Hate having to swap red and blue channel when working with GDI? Me too.

Its actually pretty feature rich for what its purpose is, more info in its [dedicated readme][Hex2Col].
