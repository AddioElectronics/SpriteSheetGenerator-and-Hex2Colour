# SpriteSheetGenerator (And Hex2Colour)
---
#### `V1.0.0`


**SpriteSheetGenerator**

Simple basic tool for rotating, mirroring, and combining sprites into a single sheet.

Can create every rotation/mirror combination and adds them to their own column or row.

**HEX2Colour**

An even more basic simple tool that helps with copying HEX colours from the web to your program.

Hate having to swap red and blue channel when working with GDI? 

Just copy your HEX values into the textbox and click convert. 

For each colour it will optionally swap the channels and format it as code.

Turns `FF0000` into `const COLORREF colour0 = 0x0000FF;`
or
`FF0000` into `Color colour0 = Color.FromArgb(0xFF0000);` depending on the settings.



Also has the ability to add them directly into an array.
